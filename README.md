This is the repository for the WiDs project of using RL in Supply Chain Analysis.
So far, 
1) I have completed an assignment testing RL in an OpenGym environment to solve the FrozenLake Problem in an 8x8 grid.
2) In the process of writing the code to create an RL model for ensuring a car completes a path in an annular circular trakc in the fastest time possible.
3) In the process of studying MARL Algorithms and understanding different scopes of research for the project.

This project, as instructed by my mentor is a project oriented towards research and is not a traditional WiDs course.
Also, I AM VERY PROUD TO SAY absolutely no ChatGPT has been used in any of the codes.
